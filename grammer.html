    <h2>1.Talk about locations with 在 (zài)</h2>
    <p>To talk about things being in places, use the word 在 (zài). This is actually a verb, so you don’t need to use any other words to talk about something being somewhere.</p>

<p>The structure is:

[noun] 在 [place][verb (or the rest of the sentance)]</p>
<h3>Have a look at some examples:</h3>

<p>我在这里。

Wǒ zài zhèlǐ.

I am here.</p>

<p>你在那里。

Nǐ zài nàlǐ.

You are there</p>

<p>上海在中国。

Shànghǎi zài Zhōngguó.

Shanghai is in China.

</p>
<p>Notice how English uses the verb “to be” where Chinese uses 在. English also uses prepositions - “to be in” - whereas Chinese often just uses 在.</p>

<h2>2.Use measure words with nouns</h2>
<p>Measure words are used whenever you talk about quantities in Chinese. You can’t attach numbers directly to nouns - you have to put a measure word in between.</p>

<p>There are different measure words for different categories of things. For example, the measure word for books is 本 (běn), whilst the measure word for flat things is 张 (zhāng).</p>

<p>Luckily, there is also a general purpose measure word: 个 (ge). This can be used for pretty much everything, but it’s better to use more specific measure words when you can.</p>
<h3>Have a look at some examples:</h3>
<p>你 有几 本 书？
Nǐ yǒu jǐ běn shū?	
How many books do you have?</p>
<p>你的公司 有几 个工人？
Nǐ de gōngsī yǒu jǐ gè gōngrén?
How many workers are there in your company?</p>
